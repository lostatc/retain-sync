# Some of these exceptions closely resemble builtins. The point of having them
# separate is to differentiate errors that should print a user-friendly error
# message as opposed to a stack trace. We don't inherit from both ProgramError
# and a related builtin exception because doing so truncates the argument list.

    """Base exception for errors anticipated during normal operation."""


class ServerError(ProgramError):
    """Raised whenever a connection to the server cannot be established."""

    """Raised whenever there is an issue with a file transfer."""
