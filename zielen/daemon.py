    Every time a file is opened in the local directory, increment its
    priority value by one. Every twenty minutes, multiply the priority
    values of each file by a constant. Run the 'sync' command at a regular
    user-defined interval.

    Attributes:
        ADJUST_INTERVAL: This is the interval of time (in seconds) to wait
            between making priority adjustments. Two files accessed within this
            interval of time will be weighted the same.
        ADJUST_CONSTANT: This is the constant used to adjust priorities for
            time. Every ADJUST_INTERVAL seconds, the priority of every file is
            multiplied by this value.
        profile: The currently selected profile.
        files_queue: A Queue for temporarily holding the paths of files hat
            have been opened in the local or remote directories before they're
            updated in the database.
