.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBzielen\fP [\fIglobal_options\fP] \fIcommand\fP [\fIcommand_options\fP] [\fIcommand_args\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBzielen\fP is a program that distributes files between a local and remote
directory based on how frequently they\(aqre accessed with the intent of
conserving disk space. This remote directory can be on a separate hard drive or
a seprate machine entirely (using ssh). Files are prioritized based on how
frequently and recently they\(aqve been accessed as well as the file size. The
highest\-priority files are kept in the local directory for quick access, while
lower priority files are moved to the remote directory to conserve disk space.
It uses symbolic links to allow files in the remote directory to be accessible
from the local one. The user can specify how much data they want to remain in
the local directory at any given point in time Multiple local directories can
be synced concurrently with either different remote directories or the same
one. Since local directories on different machines can pair with the same
remote directory, \fBzielen\fP can be used to sync files between machines.
.sp
\fBzielen\fP is intended as a single\-user solution only. It does not require root
access, and is meant to run as an unprivileged user. If the remote directory is
located on a separate machine, \fBzielen\fP does not need to be installed on that
machine to function, although you do need to have passwordless ssh access to it
(i.e. via public key authentication with an ssh agent).
.SS Terminology
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Local Directory
A local directory is a directory on your local machine that you want to
contain only that files that it has space for.
.TP
.B Remote Directory
A remote directory is a directory, either on your local machine or
elsewhere, that you want to contain a master copy of all of your files to
be synced with one or more local directories.
.TP
.B Client
A client is any computer containing a local directory that syncs with a
remote directory on another computer.
.TP
.B Profile
For every pair of directories you wish to sync, a profile must first be
generated using the \fBinitialize\fP command. Each profile has a config file
that stores information about the two directories and settings that can be
used to configure the syncing behavior (see \fI\%FILES\fP).
.TP
.B Priority
The priority is an internal value assigned to each file that is used to
determine which should stay in the local directory. It is based on how
frequently the file is accessed (weighted toward more recent access) and
the size of the file (favoring smaller files).
.TP
.B Storage Limit
The storage limit is the user\-defined amount of data that will remain in
the local directory. The program will fill the local directory until it
reaches this size, starting with the highest priority files. Excluded files
and symlinks pointing to files in the remote directory don\(aqt count toward
the storage limit. Setting it to zero will prevent any files from remaining
in the local directory.

.SH COMMANDS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBinitialize\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIname\fP
Create a new profile, called \fIname\fP, representing a pair of directories to
sync. Move files from the local directory to the remote one.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\fP \fIfile\fP
Get patterns from \fIfile\fP representing files and directories to exclude
from syncing (see \fI\%EXCLUDING\fP).
.TP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-template\fP \fIfile\fP
Get settings for the profile from the template \fIfile\fP instead of
prompting the user interactively. The user will still be prompted for
any mandatory information that is missing from the template. A blank
template can usually be found at /usr/share/zielen/config\-template.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-add\-remote\fP
Instead of moving local files to an empty remote directory, start with
an existing remote directory and an empty local directory. Using this
option, it is possible for two or more profiles to share a remote
directory.
.UNINDENT
.TP
\fBsync\fP \fIname\fP|\fIpath\fP
Bring the local and remote directories in sync and redistribute files based
on their priorities. This command accepts the absolute path of a local
initialized directory or the name of its profile. This command is run
automatically at intervals while the daemon is running.
.TP
\fBreset\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIprofile\fP|\fIpath\fP
Retrieve all files from the remote directory and de\-initialize the local
directory. This command accepts the absolute path of a local initialized
directory or the name of its profile.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
\fB\-k\fP, \fB\-\-keep\-remote\fP
Copy files from the remote directory to the local one instead of moving
them. This leaves a copy of the files in the remote directory, which is
useful when that remote directory is shared with other profiles that
may also want to retrieve the files.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-no\-retrieve\fP
Don\(aqt retrieve files from the remote directory. This still
de\-initializes the local directory, but leaves it with whatever files
are already in it. Remote files stay in the remote directory, and
symlinks to remote files are removed from the local directory. This
option supersedes \fB\-\-keep\-remote\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
\fBlist\fP
Print a table of all initialized directories and the names of their
profiles.
.TP
\fBempty\-trash\fP
Permanently delete all files in the remote directory that are marked for
deletion (see \fI\%TRASH\fP). This command accepts the absolute path of a local
initialized directory or the name of its profile.
.UNINDENT
.SH SYNCING
.sp
Whenever a profile is initialized, \fBzielen\fP will direct the user to start the
daemon for that profile. The daemon monitors file access in the local directory
and runs the \fBsync\fP command whenever a file is modified, with a cooldown
period that\(aqs configurable in the profile config file (see \fI\%FILES\fP).
.sp
A sync conflict occurs when a file has been modified in both the local and
remote directories since the last sync. Such conflicts are handled by renaming
the file that was modified the least recently. The new file name contains the
word "conflict" and the date and time of the sync. This copy is treated as a
new, independent file that is synced like any other.
.sp
When calculating which files to store locally, \fBzielen\fP first considers whole
directories, and when a directory is selected, it includes all of its
subdirectories. Once no more whole directories can fit within the storage
limit, it fills the remaining space with the highest\-priority individual files
that remain. This behavior can be overridden by setting \fBSyncExtraFiles\fP to
\(aqno\(aq in the profile config file.
.sp
During a sync, files that are new since the last sync have their priority
artifically inflated in order to keep them in the local directory longer. This
is to prevent files from being removed from the local directory as soon as
they\(aqre created, when they\(aqre likely still being used. This behavior can be
overridden by setting \fBInflatePriority\fP to \(aqno\(aq in the profile config file.
.sp
\fBzielen\fP uses \fBrsync\fP for copying files between the local and remote
directories, and should preserve symbolic links, permissions, modification
times, ownership, hard links, ACLs, extended attributes and sparse files as
long as both filesystems support them. The program deliberately does not sync
user\-created symlinks. The rationale behind this is that absolute links will be
broken when copied to another directory.
.SH EXCLUDING
.sp
Files and directories can be excluded from syncing using the exclude pattern
file (see \fI\%FILES\fP). Each line in the file specifies a shell globbing pattern
that represents files to exclude. Excluded files stay in the local directory
and don\(aqt count toward the storage limit. If a file is not already in the local
directory, it is copied from the remote directory during the next sync. In
single\-client configurations, the file is then removed from the remote
directory. In multi\-client configurations, a file is removed from the remote
directory only when it has been excluded by each client that shares that remote
directory. Until then, a copy remains in the remote directory and all copies of
the file stay in sync.
.sp
Patterns have the following format:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Lines starting with a pound sign \(aq#\(aq serve as comments.
.IP \(bu 2
An asterisk \(aq*\(aq matches anything, but stops at slashes.
.IP \(bu 2
A double asterisk \(aq**\(aq matches anything, including slashes.
.IP \(bu 2
A question mark \(aq?\(aq matches any single character.
.IP \(bu 2
A set of brackets \(aq[]\(aq matches any single character contained within the
brackets.
.IP \(bu 2
To match any of the above meta\-characters literally, wrap them in brackets.
.IP \(bu 2
Patterns starting with a slash match file paths relative to the root of the
sync directory.
.IP \(bu 2
Patterns not starting with a slash match the ends of file paths anywhere in
the tree.
.UNINDENT
.SH TRASH
.sp
Before \fBzielen\fP deletes a file in the remote directory, it first searches for
the file in the user\(aqs local trash directory by comparing file sizes first and
then checksums. If it finds a copy of the file in the user\(aqs trash, it
permanently deletes the file in the remote directory. Otherwise, it only marks
the file for deletion. Files marked for deletion are kept in the remote
directory and renamed to include the word "deleted" and the time and date of
the sync. This behavior can be overridden by setting \fBDeleteAlways\fP to \(aqyes\(aq
in the profile config file. The command \fBempty\-trash\fP can be used to
permanently delete all files in the remote directory that are marked for
deletion. The list of directories that are searched for deleted files can be
altered in the profile config file.
.SH FILES
